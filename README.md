Sinatra demo
============

Simple Sinatra demo

Pointers
========

Fork this repo before you modify it, then clone it from your fork so you can
commit your work.

I would suggest using rbenv to manage your Ruby version, it can be found here:

https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv

The project was last tested with Ruby version 2.4.4 so that should be your
target for rbenv.

You will also want to install bundler once you have Ruby installed:

```
gem install bundle
```

Once you have a copy of the repo you should be able to do the following in the
cloned directory:

```
bundle install
rackup
```

Then you will be able to see the page produced with your browser at:
http://localhost:9292
